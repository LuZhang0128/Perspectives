# Perspectives
The code and data in this repository is for the Perspectives Class Project, Spring 2022, at the University of Chicago. 

The [code](https://github.com/LuZhang0128/Perspectives/blob/main/Collected%20data%20and%20initial%20findings.ipynb) is written in Python 3.7 on Google Colab. <br>
All data used in this project, as well as the saved outputs, can be found [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y1267sa7shpWpW31RBivD_CmDNQ07AeC?usp=sharing).

# Load and Clean Data
I've collaborated with my friend and have written a scraper for Twitter data. I am currently unable to share the scraper with the class.
<br>

This scraper only randomly send back a certain amount of Tweets per day every time I try to make request through the code. For this class project, I just used one output file. The raw data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19umvDYuu1o6uIr3xz1m0qwLay4qgeQ5r/view?usp=sharing). This project can expand the scale by running with multiple output files in the data folder. 
<br>

You can pre-process the data by running the `Load and Clean Data` section in Google Colab code. 
<br>

In this section, I removed urls and uninformative information like websites and '@'s. I then splited data into before and after the death of George Floyd. I then tokenized and normalized all tweets using the packages developed by Prof. James Evans' research team. 
<br>

The pre-processed data can be found [here in csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Szztx7LW-QGuvejjWfl9eea9oJ_whtFQ/view?usp=sharing) or [here in pkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bhXF7WidraR3qkpzv9giXaR5WZGov78k/view?usp=sharing).
